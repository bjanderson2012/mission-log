# mission-log

## Mission
Transition from healthcare into **IT support (service desk/help desk)** and build toward **security-adjacent work** (SOC-style triage / threat intel). This repo is my evidence trail: real troubleshooting, documentation, and repeatable process — **no hype, no overselling**.

## Start Here (best artifacts)
- **Case Note:** [Case-001 — Home Internet Outage Triage](Portfolio/Case_Notes/case-001-home-internet-outage-triage.md)
- **Runbook:** [Basic Network Troubleshooting Ladder](Portfolio/Runbooks/runbook-basic-network-troubleshooting-ladder.md)
- **Template:** [Ticket-Style Case Note Template](Portfolio/Templates/template-ticket-case-note.md)
- **Sanitization:** [Sanitization Checklist](Portfolio/Templates/sanitization-checklist.md)

## What’s inside
- **Portfolio (proof / recruiter-facing):** [Portfolio/](Portfolio/)
- **TryHackMe notes (training):** [TryHackMe/](TryHackMe/)

## Current focus
- Ticket workflow: troubleshooting, documentation, escalation habits
- Core IT fundamentals: Windows, networking basics, identity/MFA basics, endpoints
- Security mindset: triage thinking (“what’s normal vs suspicious”), safe handling of data
- Proof of work: small, readable artifacts that show how I operate

## How I work (my method)
1) Confirm scope (one device vs many)  
2) Prove local connectivity (gateway ping)  
3) Prove internet by IP (8.8.8.8) then DNS (nslookup)  
4) Document steps + results in order  
5) Conclude + next steps (fix / workaround / escalate)

## Ground rules
- **Sanitized by default:** no personal identifiers, account info, IMEI/serial, or sensitive details
- **Evidence > claims:** I only write what I verified; assumptions are labeled
- **Consistency over intensity:** steady reps, shipped artifacts

## Long-term direction (interest)
I’m interested in **AI ethics/safety and AI misuse** — how AI can support investigations and reduce harm (OSINT workflows, abuse/scam patterns, alert triage). I’m not claiming AI expertise today; I’ll add small, practical artifacts as I learn.
